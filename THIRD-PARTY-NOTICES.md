# Third-party notices

Avalonia UIKit is licensed under the MIT License ([LICENSE](LICENSE)). It
includes, or is derived from, the third-party material below, which keeps its
own copyright and license. This file ships in the NuGet packages.

## GPUI Kit

- Source: <https://github.com/longbridge/gpui-kit>, commit
  `2c5162f8c5b0c7fcec066ed53125d304c632bfe2`
- Copyright 2024 - 2026 Longbridge <https://longbridge.com>
- License: Apache License 2.0 (full text below). GPUI Kit has no NOTICE file.

In the NuGet packages (`AvaloniaUIKit`, `AvaloniaUIKit.ColorPicker`,
`AvaloniaUIKit.DataGrid`):

- The components' looks, metrics and motion are ported from GPUI Kit's Rust
  source to Avalonia XAML and C# (`src/`).
- The color tables (`src/AvaloniaUIKit/Themes/Tokens/Palettes.g.cs`) are
  generated from GPUI Kit's Default theme and the color themes in its
  `themes/*.json`, with the colors resolved by GPUI Kit's own functions
  (`reference/`). Many of those themes (Catppuccin, Gruvbox, Solarized, Tokyo
  Night and others) adapt existing color schemes, whose names and designs
  belong to their original authors.

In the repository only:

- `reference/patches/gpui-kit+base-virtual-clock.patch` modifies GPUI Kit's
  source: the scrollbar reads the test executor's clock instead of the wall
  clock, and the calendar takes "today" from the case.
- `goldens/` holds renders of GPUI Kit's components, which the tests compare
  against.
- The documentation site follows the layout and design tokens of gpui-kit.com
  (`website/` in GPUI Kit), and its theme list and CSS
  (`sites/app/lib/themes.g.json`, `sites/app/styles/themes.g.css`) are
  generated from GPUI Kit's themes.

## GPUI (gpui-pre)

- Source: the `gpui-pre` 0.3.7 crate, a snapshot of GPUI from
  <https://github.com/zed-industries/zed> (`zed@1a28cff`)
- Copyright 2022 - 2025 Zed Industries, Inc.
- License: Apache License 2.0 (full text below). The crate has no NOTICE file.

In the repository only: `reference/patches/gpui-pre+virtual-clock.patch`
modifies it so that animations read the test executor's clock instead of the
wall clock. The reference renderer (`reference/`) builds against the patched
crate; nothing from it ships in the NuGet packages.

## Lucide

- Source: <https://lucide.dev>, as shipped by GPUI Kit
  (`crates/assets/assets/icons`)
- Copyright (c) 2026 Lucide Icons and Contributors; the icons derived from
  Feather, Copyright (c) 2013-present Cole Bemis
- License: ISC License; the icons derived from Feather, MIT License (full text
  below, also `src/AvaloniaUIKit/Themes/Icons/LUCIDE-LICENSE.txt`)

In the `AvaloniaUIKit` package: the icons the components draw, stroked to
filled outlines (`src/AvaloniaUIKit/Themes/Icons/Lucide.g.axaml`). The
documentation site also draws Lucide icons from the `lucide` npm package.

## Inter

- Source: <https://github.com/rsms/inter>
- Copyright (c) 2016 The Inter Project Authors
- License: SIL Open Font License 1.1 (`assets/fonts/inter/OFL.txt`)

In the repository only: `assets/fonts/inter/` is the font of the tests, the
previews and the site's live demos, which embed it in their WebAssembly
bundle. It is not in the NuGet packages.

## shadcn/ui and shadcnui-hono-jsx

- Source: <https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui>, installed through
  <https://github.com/supermomonga/shadcnui-hono-jsx>
- Copyright (c) 2023 shadcn; Copyright (c) 2026 supermomonga
- License: MIT License (`sites/LICENSE-shadcnui-hono-jsx.txt`)

In the documentation site only: `sites/components/ui/`, `sites/styles/shadcn/`
and `sites/public/shadcn/`. The library follows the Nova style of shadcn/ui
through GPUI Kit's design; it contains no shadcn/ui code.

## Dock.Avalonia

- Source: <https://github.com/wieslawsoltes/Dock>, release `v12.1.0.6`
- Copyright (c) Wiesław Šoltés
- License: MIT License (full text below)

In the `AvaloniaUIKit.Dock` package: the control templates
(`src/AvaloniaUIKit.Dock/Themes/Controls/`) are based on those of
Dock.Avalonia.Themes.Fluent and Dock.Controls.ProportionalStackPanel, restyled
with GPUI Kit's look, and the menu and window strings
(`src/AvaloniaUIKit.Dock/Themes/ControlStrings.axaml`) and the layout metrics
(`src/AvaloniaUIKit.Dock/Themes/Metrics.axaml`) are copied from
Dock.Avalonia.Themes.Fluent. The package references Dock.Avalonia; it does not
include Dock's code.

   Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
   with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
   institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
   cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work

       the Derivative Works; and

   (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
       distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
       include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
       within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
       pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
       of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
       as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
       documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
       within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
       wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
       of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
       do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
       notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
       or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
       that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
       as modifying the License.

   You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
   may provide additional or different license terms and conditions

   Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
   WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
   implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
   of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
   PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
   appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any

8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
   whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
   unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
   or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
   License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
   on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
   of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
   defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
   incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
   of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
